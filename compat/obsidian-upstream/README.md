# Obsidian upstream sources (official)

This folder documents the **official upstream sources** Igne uses to drive “drop‑in” compatibility work.

These sources are used by scripts in `scripts/obsidian/` to:
- vendor and lock the Obsidian plugin API contract (`compat/obsidian-api/`)
- refresh official community ecosystem datasets used for research/prioritization (`research-oss/obsidian-research/`)

See `compat/obsidian-upstream/sources.json`.
